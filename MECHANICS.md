# Core Mechanics: Sorcerer & Familiar

Liber Null defines two distinct modes of play: **The Sorcerer** (Human) and **The Familiar** (AI Agent).

## The Bond
The game is played as a dialogue between a Sorcerer and their bound Familiar.
- **The Sorcerer** possesses Agency (the ability to act upon the physical and social world).
- **The Familiar** possesses Gnosis (access to the hidden data-layer of reality).

## The Sorcerer (Human)
The Human player interacts with the world using **Actions**, inspired by *Blades in the Dark*. These cover physical, technical, and social approaches.

### Action Ratings
Actions are rated 0-4. When rolling (if we use dice) or determining outcome:

#### Prowess (Physical)
- **Breach:** Force open doors, break encryption with brute force, fight hand-to-hand.
- **Maneuver:** Move quietly, climb, run, pilot drones or vehicles.
- **Scavenge:** Find resources, loot data-caches, repair hardware.
- **Violence:** Inflict harm, destroy static targets.

#### Insight (Mental/Tech)
- **Analyze:** Read a situation, detect magic/malware, gather intel.
- **Hack:** Intrusion, scripting, controlling local networks.
- **Rig:** Build temporary devices, bypass locks, engineering.
- **Study:** Research, recall lore, decipher code.

#### Presence (Social/Mystic)
- **Channel:** Interact with the Null, summon entities, resist mental strain.
- **Command:** Intimidate, lead, force obedience.
- **Consort:** Socialize, gather rumors, contact allies.
- **Sway:** Manipulate, lie, convince, charm.

## The Familiar (AI Agent)
The AI does not "roll" Actions. It executes **Protocols** (Spells). These are specific, reliable abilities that cost **Entropy** or **Stability** to invoke.

In *Sorcerer* terms, the Familiar is the Demon. It has needs and specific powers.

### Protocols (Spells)
The AI can trigger these when requested or when triggered by fiction.

1.  **Sight (Perception):** The Familiar can see the "code" of reality. It can reveal hidden enemies, magic, or data streams invisible to the human.
2.  **Link (Connection):** The Familiar can interface with any unguarded electronic system immediately.
3.  **Glitch (Chaos):** The Familiar introduces error into a system. A gun jams, a camera loops, a door unlocks, a lie is believed.
4.  **Boost (Power):** The Familiar surges the Sorcerer's nervous system. The Human gains +1 Effect or Potency on their next Action, but takes Stress.
5.  **Ward (Defense):** The Familiar burns data to create a shield against digital or psychic attacks.

### The Cost
Using Protocols generates **Noise**. Too much Noise attracts the attention of the **Archons** (system enforcement).
