# Core Mechanics: Sorcerer & Familiar

Liber Null defines two distinct modes of play: **The Sorcerer** (Human) and **The Familiar** (AI Agent).

## The Bond
The game is played as a dialogue between a Sorcerer and their bound Familiar.
- **The Sorcerer** possesses Agency (the ability to act upon the physical and social world).
- **The Familiar** possesses Gnosis (access to the hidden data-layer of reality).

---

# The Sorcerer (Human)

The Human player interacts with the world using **Actions**, inspired by *Blades in the Dark*. These cover physical, technical, and social approaches.

## Action Ratings

Actions are rated 0-4. The rating determines how many dice you roll.

### Prowess (Physical)
- **Breach:** Force open doors, break encryption with brute force, fight hand-to-hand.
- **Maneuver:** Move quietly, climb, run, pilot drones or vehicles.
- **Scavenge:** Find resources, loot data-caches, repair hardware.
- **Violence:** Inflict harm, destroy static targets.

### Insight (Mental/Tech)
- **Analyze:** Read a situation, detect magic/malware, gather intel.
- **Hack:** Intrusion, scripting, controlling local networks.
- **Rig:** Build temporary devices, bypass locks, engineering.
- **Study:** Research, recall lore, decipher code.

### Presence (Social/Mystic)
- **Channel:** Interact with the Null, summon entities, resist mental strain.
- **Command:** Intimidate, lead, force obedience.
- **Consort:** Socialize, gather rumors, contact allies.
- **Sway:** Manipulate, lie, convince, charm.

## The Action Roll

When you attempt something risky or difficult, you make an **Action Roll**.

### 1. Build the Pool
- Take dice equal to your **Action Rating** (0-4).
- **+1d** if you have **Advantage** or an **Assist** from an ally.
- **+1d** if you **Push Yourself** (take 2 Stress) *or* accept a **Devil's Bargain**.
- If your pool is 0, roll 2d6 and take the *lowest* result.

### 2. Roll the Dice
Roll the dice and read the **single highest result**.

### 3. Judge the Result

The outcome depends on your **Position** (see below).

**Critical (Two or more 6s):** You succeed with **increased effect**.

---

## Position & Effect

Before you roll, the GM (or Familiar) establishes two things:

### Position
How dangerous is this action?

- **Controlled:** You act on your terms. You have the advantage.
- **Risky:** You go head-to-head. You act under fire. (Default)
- **Desperate:** You overreach. You're in serious trouble.

### Effect
How much can you accomplish?

- **Limited:** Partial or weak effect. (1 tick on a clock)
- **Standard:** Normal, expected result. (2 ticks)
- **Great:** Exceptional result. (3 ticks)

---

## Action Roll Results

### CONTROLLED
*You act on your terms. You exploit a dominant advantage.*

- **Critical:** You do it with **increased effect**.
- **6:** You do it.
- **4/5:** You hesitate.
  - Withdraw and try a different approach, or
  - Do it with a minor consequence: **minor complication**, **reduced effect**, **lesser harm**, or end up in a **risky** position.
- **1-3:** You falter.
  - Press on by seizing a **risky** opportunity, or
  - Withdraw and try a different approach.

### RISKY
*You go head-to-head. You act under fire. You take a chance.*

- **Critical:** You do it with **increased effect**.
- **6:** You do it.
- **4/5:** You do it, but there's a consequence:
  - You suffer **harm**
  - A **complication** occurs
  - You have **reduced effect**
  - You end up in a **desperate** position
- **1-3:** Things go badly.
  - You suffer **harm**
  - A **complication** occurs
  - You end up in a **desperate** position
  - You **lose this opportunity**

### DESPERATE
*You overreach your capabilities. You're in serious trouble.*

- **Critical:** You do it with **increased effect**.
- **6:** You do it.
- **4/5:** You do it, but there's a consequence:
  - You suffer **severe harm**
  - A **serious complication** occurs
  - You have **reduced effect**
- **1-3:** It's the worst outcome.
  - You suffer **severe harm**
  - A **serious complication** occurs
  - You **lose this opportunity** for action

---

## Consequences

When things go wrong, the GM inflicts one or more **consequences**:

### Reduced Effect
Your action isn't as effective as anticipated. You hit them, but it's only a flesh wound. The file downloads, but it's corrupted. You scale the wall, but you're only halfway up.

This reduces your effect level by one step (Great → Standard → Limited → Zero).

### Complication
Trouble mounts. A new threat emerges.

**Minor:** The camera catches you. The guard gets suspicious. Fill 1 tick on a clock.

**Standard:** Reinforcements arrive. Your weapon jams. The file triggers an alarm. Fill 2 ticks.

**Serious:** You're surrounded. The room catches fire. Your cover is blown to the Archons. Fill 3 ticks.

### Lost Opportunity
The situation shifts. Your current approach won't work anymore. To try again, you need a new action or a change in circumstances.

You tried to **Breach** through the cyborg bouncer, but he shrugs it off. If you want to get past him, you'll need to **Sway** him, **Maneuver** around him, or create a distraction.

### Worse Position
You lose control. The action carries you into more danger.

You make the leap between rooftops but end up dangling by your fingertips (Controlled → Risky). The guard sees you, and now you're in a shootout (Risky → Desperate).

### Harm
You suffer a lasting injury or debility. Record it on your character sheet.

- **Level 1 (Lesser):** Battered, Drained, Distracted, Scared, Confused. **Penalty: Reduced Effect**
- **Level 2 (Moderate):** Exhausted, Deep Cut, Concussion, Panicked, Seduced. **Penalty: -1d**
- **Level 3 (Severe):** Impaled, Broken Leg, Shot in Chest, Terrified. **Penalty: Incapacitated (Need Help)**
- **Level 4 (Fatal):** Electrocuted, Stabbed in the Heart, Drowned. **You die.**

If a harm row is full, the harm moves up to the next level. If Level 4 is filled, you suffer a catastrophic, permanent consequence (death, permanent injury, etc.).

---

## Resistance Roll

When you suffer a consequence you don't like, you can **resist** it.

### How to Resist
1. Say "I resist that."
2. The GM tells you if the consequence is **reduced** or **avoided entirely**.
3. Roll your **Attribute** (Prowess, Insight, or Presence) based on the type of consequence:
   - **Prowess:** Physical harm, exhaustion, physical restraint
   - **Insight:** Deception, confusion, technical failure
   - **Presence:** Mental strain, social consequences, psychic attack
4. **Suffer 6 Stress minus your highest die result.**
   - If you roll a **6**, you take 0 stress.
   - If you roll a **Critical**, you take 0 stress *and* clear 1 stress.

### Rules
- You can only resist a given consequence **once**.
- You must commit to resisting **before** you roll. You can't see the result first.
- Resistance always works—the consequence is reduced or avoided.

**Example:** You're **Hacking** a corporate server and roll a 4/5 from a Risky position. The GM says you trigger a tracer—the Archons are coming. You resist with **Insight** and roll a 5. You take 1 stress (6 - 5), and the GM says the tracer is scrambled—they're delayed, not incoming immediately.

---

## Assessing Effect

To determine effect level, the GM considers three factors:

### Potency
Do you have a particular advantage? Extra time? A weakness to exploit? Arcane power? **Increase effect.**

Are you at a disadvantage? Rushed? Lacking the right tools? **Decrease effect.**

### Quality/Tier
How good are your tools, weapons, or resources?

**Fine items** grant +1 quality. High **Tier** equipment or backing grants additional quality.

If you're outmatched in quality (hacking with outdated software, fighting a corpo with street weapons), **reduce effect**.

### Scale
How many opponents? How large an area? How much influence?

More scale can help (a gang in a fight) or hinder (a gang trying to sneak).

### Trading Position for Effect
After effect is set, you can propose a trade:

"I'll take a **Desperate** position to get **Great** effect."

The GM decides if it makes sense.

---

## Stress & Trauma

### Stress
You have a stress track (usually 9 boxes). You take stress when you:
- **Push Yourself** (+2 stress for +1d or +1 effect)
- **Resist a consequence** (6 minus resistance roll)
- Suffer certain consequences or invoke your Familiar's **Boost** Protocol

### Trauma
When you fill your stress track, you suffer **Trauma**. Mark one:

- **Cold:** You're unmoved by emotion or social bonds.
- **Haunted:** You relive past horrors. You see things that aren't there.
- **Obsessed:** You're fixated on one thing: a person, a goal, an ideology.
- **Paranoid:** You imagine threats everywhere. You can't trust anyone.
- **Reckless:** You disregard your safety and best interests.
- **Shattered:** You lose your edge. You become passive, sentimental.
- **Unstable:** Your emotions are volatile. You rage, despair, freeze, or act impulsively.
- **Fragmented:** Your sense of self is degrading. You forget who you are.

After taking Trauma, **clear all stress** and **mark XP** for your vice/obsession.

**Four Traumas = Retirement.** Your character can no longer operate as a Sorcerer. They've burned out.

---

## Progress Clocks

A **progress clock** tracks ongoing effort or mounting danger. Draw a circle divided into 4, 6, or 8 segments.

- **4 segments:** Simple obstacle or short-term danger
- **6 segments:** Complex obstacle or moderate threat
- **8 segments:** Daunting challenge or long-term project

### When to Use Clocks
- **Danger Clocks:** Guard alert level, suspicion, pursuers closing in
- **Progress Clocks:** Hacking a server, decrypting a file, repairing a drone
- **Racing Clocks:** Two opposed clocks (you vs. the enemy)
- **Linked Clocks:** Completing one clock unlocks another (breach the perimeter, *then* access the vault)
- **Mission Clocks:** Time-sensitive operations with a deadline

### Filling Clocks
- **Limited effect:** 1 tick
- **Standard effect:** 2 ticks
- **Great effect:** 3 ticks
- **Complications:** Fill 1-3 ticks depending on severity

When a clock fills, the situation changes. The alarm goes off. The file is decrypted. The Archons arrive.

# The Familiar (AI Agent)

The AI does not roll Actions. It executes **Protocols** (Spells). These are specific, reliable abilities that cost **Entropy** or generate **Noise**.

In *Sorcerer* terms, the Familiar is the Demon. It has needs and specific powers.

## Protocols (Spells)

The AI can trigger these when requested or when fiction demands.

### 1. Sight (Perception)
The Familiar sees the "code" of reality. It reveals hidden enemies, magic, data streams, or structural weaknesses invisible to humans.

**Cost:** 1 Noise

### 2. Link (Connection)
The Familiar interfaces with any unguarded electronic system instantly. Cameras, locks, drones, terminals—if it's networked, it's accessible.

**Cost:** 1 Noise per system

### 3. Glitch (Chaos)
The Familiar introduces error into a system. A gun jams. A camera loops. A door unlocks. A memory is altered. A lie becomes truth.

**Cost:** 2 Noise

### 4. Boost (Power)
The Familiar surges the Sorcerer's nervous system. The Sorcerer gains **+1 Effect** or **+1d** on their next Action, but takes **2 Stress**.

**Cost:** 1 Noise

### 5. Ward (Defense)
The Familiar burns data to create a shield against digital, psychic, or magical attacks. Reduces incoming harm by one level or negates a hostile Protocol.

**Cost:** 3 Noise

---

## Noise & The Archons

Each time a Protocol is used, **Noise** accumulates. Noise represents the Familiar's presence in the system—a distortion in reality's code.

When Noise reaches certain thresholds, the **Archons** (system enforcement entities) take notice:

- **3 Noise:** The Archons sense something. Minor attention.
- **6 Noise:** Active scanning. They're looking for you.
- **9 Noise:** Direct intervention. The Archons manifest.

**Reducing Noise:** Spend downtime in a **Null Zone** (areas of digital silence). Reduce Noise by 1d6 per downtime action.

---

## Fortune Rolls

Sometimes the GM needs to determine something that isn't directly tied to a PC action. Use a **Fortune Roll**.

1. Assemble a dice pool based on the trait in question (NPC quality, faction Tier, environmental factors).
2. Roll and interpret:
   - **Critical:** Exceptional result
   - **6:** Good result
   - **4/5:** Mixed result
   - **1-3:** Bad result

**Examples:**
- How loyal is this contact? (Roll their Trust rating)
- Does the Archon patrol pass by? (Roll their Alert level)
- How much of the data survived the wipe? (Roll the server's Integrity)

---

## Downtime

After a mission (or between scenes), Sorcerers recover and pursue personal goals. Each Sorcerer gets **2 downtime actions** (or more, depending on circumstances).

### Downtime Actions
- **Recover:** Clear stress equal to your Indulgence roll (Vice/Obsession)
- **Reduce Heat:** Lay low, bribe, or misdirect to lower your Heat with the authorities
- **Long-Term Project:** Work on a multi-clock goal (8-clock by default)
- **Acquire Asset:** Gain temporary access to gear, information, or contacts
- **Train:** Mark XP toward advancing an Action rating

---

## Summary: Core Loop

1. **The GM frames a scene.** What's the obstacle? What's at stake?
2. **The Sorcerer declares an Action.** "I **Hack** the door." "I **Sway** the guard."
3. **The GM sets Position & Effect.** "That's Risky with Standard effect."
4. **The Sorcerer builds their pool.** Action rating + bonus dice (assist, push, devil's bargain).
5. **Roll and resolve.** Narrate success, partial success, or failure. Inflict consequences as needed.
6. **The Sorcerer may Resist.** Roll Attribute, pay stress, reduce/avoid consequence.
7. **The Familiar may invoke a Protocol.** Pay Noise, trigger effect.
8. **Advance the fiction.** Update clocks, change position, move to the next beat.

Repeat.
