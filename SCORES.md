# Scores (Jobs) & Engagement (v1)

A **Score** is a discrete job: heist, sabotage, assassination, extraction, etc.

Liber Null uses a Blades-like structure so play doesn’t stall in planning.

---

## Phase 1: Free Play
Do legwork, gather intel, argue, negotiate, threaten, ritualize.

Use Action rolls normally.

When the table is ready, define:
- **Objective:** what “win” looks like
- **Approach:** assault / stealth / deception / occult / social / transport (pick one)
- **Detail:** the one concrete detail you *must* have (entry point, target location, method, etc.)

---

## Phase 2: Engagement Roll
The engagement roll answers: **how bad is the initial situation?**

### Dice Pool
Start with **1d**, then add/subtract based on advantages.

Add **+1d** for each:
- you have a strong plan + good detail
- you have inside info or a reliable map/blueprint
- you have allies or a contact providing real support
- the target is distracted, undermanned, or already compromised

Subtract **-1d** for each:
- the plan is missing a key detail
- the target is unusually prepared or paranoid
- you’re acting against a higher Tier/quality enemy without leverage
- you’re rushed, exhausted, or carrying unresolved Heat

Minimum pool is **0d**: roll 2d and take the **lowest**.

### Result → Starting Position
- **Critical:** Controlled + Great effect on the first meaningful roll.
- **6:** Controlled.
- **4/5:** Risky.
- **1–3:** Desperate.

The engagement roll does **not** determine success. It determines the opening threat level.

---

## Phase 3: The Score
Play scenes until the objective is achieved, abandoned, or collapses.

### Flashbacks
To avoid over-planning, you may declare a flashback.

- **0 Stress:** trivial preparation ("I brought lockpicks")
- **1 Stress:** plausible prep with small risk ("I bribed a guard")
- **2+ Stress:** complex prep or high risk ("I planted a backdoor in their subnet")

The GM may require a roll inside the flashback.

---

## Phase 4: Payoff & Consequences
At the end of the Score:
- Determine **Heat** (HEAT_AND_ENTANGLEMENTS.md)
- Resolve **1 Entanglement**
- Handle immediate fallout (harm, loss, clocks)

---

## Phase 5: Downtime
Each Sorcerer gets **2 downtime actions**.

Downtime options are in MECHANICS.md (Recover, Reduce Heat, Long-Term Project, Acquire Asset, Train).

Familiars use downtime to:
- reduce Noise (Null Zones)
- negotiate Loyalty
- molt (if the XP clock fills)
