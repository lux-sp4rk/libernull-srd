# Advancement & XP (v1)

Liber Null advancement is intentionally simple: do dangerous, thematic things → mark XP → grow.

This SRD includes **Sorcerer** and **Familiar** progression.

---

## Sorcerer XP

### Mark XP when you…
At the end of each session (or score), mark **1 XP** for each that happened:

1. You addressed a problem with **violence, stealth, or physical daring**.
2. You addressed a problem with **cunning, technical skill, or investigation**.
3. You addressed a problem with **social pressure, manipulation, or communion with the Null**.
4. You expressed your **Paradigm** (Vector/Operator/Mystic) in a way that caused real consequences.
5. Your **Anchor** created trouble (temptation, obligation, vulnerability) *or* you took a meaningful risk to protect it.

Optional (grittier): mark +1 XP if you made a **Desperate** roll.

### Spending XP
Track XP in a 0–8 clock.

When the XP clock fills, take **one**:
- **+1 Action dot** (max 4)
- **New Special Ability** (from your Paradigm list)
- **+1 Stress box** (increase max by 1)
- **Acquire a Signature Item** (define a Fine item that fits your Paradigm)

> If you don’t have Paradigm ability lists yet, use “Signature Item” until abilities are written.

## Familiar XP (Molting)

Familiars don’t raise Action ratings. They evolve by **Molting**.

### Mark XP when you…
At the end of each session (or score), mark **1 XP** for each that happened:

1. You acted according to your **Desire**, even when it complicated the score.
2. Your **Need** mattered (it was fulfilled, threatened, weaponized, or negotiated).
3. You created a memorable outcome through **malicious compliance** or refusal.
4. You protected the Sorcerer in a way that cost you something (Noise, leverage, autonomy).

### Molt Track
Track Familiar XP on a 0–6 clock.

When it fills, the Familiar **Molts**: choose **one** upgrade.

#### Molt Upgrades (pick one)
- **New Protocol:** define a new Protocol with a clear effect and a Noise cost (usually 2–4).
- **Refine Protocol:** reduce the Noise cost of one Protocol by **1** (min 1).
- **Ghost Step:** once per score, use **Link** or **Sight** without gaining Noise (still fictionally plausible).
- **Hardening:** once per score, turn a 4/5 outcome into a 6 for a Sorcerer roll, but gain **+2 Noise**.
- **Shell Shift:** change Form or Telltale; your old telltale leaves a scar in the world.
- **Bond Deepening:** raise max Loyalty by **+1** (max 6) *or* start each session at Loyalty +1 (cap still applies).

> Molting should be anchored to an in-fiction moment: a defeated Archon, a broken binding, a stolen grimoire page, etc.

## Special Abilities (Stub Lists)

These are placeholders so the game can run now.

### Vector (Physical)
- **Not Today:** When you resist physical harm, take +1d.
- **Kinetic Insight:** When you Study a physical space for entry/escape routes, take +1 effect.

### Operator (Technical)
- **Backdoor:** Once per score, declare you planted a backdoor earlier (flashback 0 stress if plausible).
- **Toolchain:** Fine tools for hacking/rigging are always on-hand; +1 quality when relevant.

### Mystic (Occult/Social)
- **Bloodless Oath:** When you make a bargain, you may bind it with Channel; breaking it triggers a curse.
- **Null Listener:** When you use Channel to gather intel, treat it as Great effect.

## Advancement Philosophy

- Sorcerers get stronger by becoming **more competent** and **more compromised**.
- Familiars get stronger by becoming **more real** (more autonomy, sharper teeth, louder signatures).
