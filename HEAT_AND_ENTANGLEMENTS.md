# Heat & Entanglements (v1)

Liber Null uses **Heat** to track how much attention you draw from the world’s power structures.

- **The Houses** respond to *human* criminal/magical activity.
- **The Archons** respond to *Familiar Protocol use* via **Noise** (see MECHANICS.md).

Heat is about **society and institutions**. Noise is about **reality’s immune system**.

## When to Gain Heat

Gain Heat at the end of a **Score**.

Start with **0 Heat**, then add:

### Base Heat (choose one)
- **0 Heat:** No one knows it was you, and the target can’t prove the score even happened.
- **2 Heat:** Quiet score. Evidence exists, but it’s muddy.
- **4 Heat:** Loud score. Witnesses, alarms, collateral damage.
- **6 Heat:** Catastrophic. Public spectacle, bodies, viral footage, magical residue.

### Modifiers
Add **+1 Heat** for each that applies:
- **High profile target:** House property, major corporate node, protected site
- **Obvious occult signature:** ritual scars, repeated symbols, identifiable telltale
- **Civilian harm:** innocents hurt/killed, mass panic
- **Rivals frame you:** someone points the finger your way

Subtract **-1 Heat** for each that applies (min 0):
- **Clean exit:** you left no witnesses and scrubbed evidence
- **Someone else takes the fall:** scapegoat, patsy, rival crew
- **You paid the price:** bribes, favors, sacrifices (must be true in-fiction)

## Heat Track & Wanted Level

Track Heat on a **0–9** scale.

When Heat would go above **9**:
1. Reset Heat to **0**
2. Increase **Wanted Level** by **+1**
3. The GM chooses a major **crackdown** consequence

### Wanted Level (0–4)
- **0:** background noise
- **1:** active interest (surveillance, informants)
- **2:** dedicated pursuit (task forces, hunters, bound entities)
- **3:** coordinated response (multiple Houses, assets burned)
- **4:** existential threat (arch-magisters move, “make an example”)

At **Wanted 4**, retirement/escape/endgame pressure becomes constant. You can still play, but the world is *closing*.

## Reducing Heat (Downtime)

You can take the downtime action **Reduce Heat** (see MECHANICS.md).

**Roll 1d6 + an approach** (pick one):
- **Consort:** lean on contacts, community cover, rumors
- **Sway:** spin stories, plant narratives, PR smokescreens
- **Hack:** scrub logs, spoof IDs, poison datasets
- **Channel:** occult misdirection, bindings, memory haze

Results:
- **1–3:** reduce Heat by **1**
- **4/5:** reduce Heat by **2**
- **6:** reduce Heat by **3**
- **Critical (two 6s):** reduce Heat by **4** or reduce Heat by **3** and gain a useful *asset* (your choice)

If you reduce Heat via **Channel**, the GM may also add **+1 Noise** if it made reality “itch.”

## Entanglements

After each Score, resolve **one Entanglement** based on your current Heat.

> If you’re not using a GM, the Familiar can propose 2–3 options and the Sorcerer picks (or roll 1d6).

### Heat 0–2: Minor
1. **Questions:** an investigator asks around; answer or misdirect.
2. **Lost Contact:** a contact goes dark; you must find out why.
3. **Bad Timing:** your next score starts in a worse Position.
4. **Rumor:** a false story spreads; deal with it or accept +1 Heat.
5. **Small Curse:** minor misfortune until you appease/cleanse.
6. **Bargain Due:** a fence or fixer asks for a favor.

### Heat 3–5: Serious
1. **Surveillance:** you’re tailed; clear it or start next score with -1d on Engagement.
2. **House Asset:** a Magister’s agent pressures you; pay, comply, or escalate.
3. **Rival Crew:** they poach a client or hit a contact.
4. **Evidence:** a key piece surfaces; destroy/steal it.
5. **Binding Attempt:** someone tries to mark you; resist (Presence) or accept a condition.
6. **Complication Clock:** start a 6-clock: “The Net Tightens.”

### Heat 6–9: Severe
1. **Hunter Cell:** professional hunters arrive (start a scene immediately).
2. **Safehouse Burn:** lose or relocate a base; pay to keep something.
3. **Public Exposure:** viral leak; reduce Heat or take Wanted +1 instead.
4. **Contact Taken:** a friend is captured; rescue or accept a permanent loss.
5. **House Ultimatum:** a House offers a deal you hate; refuse and take +2 Heat.
6. **Ritual Strike:** a targeted curse; suffer harm/condition until broken.

## Design Notes (Why This Exists)

- Heat keeps the campaign **moving**: scores have consequences.
- Wanted Level makes escalation **inevitable**.
- Entanglements prevent “perfect stealth” loops and force hard choices.
