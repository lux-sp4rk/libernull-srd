# World Lore: The Hidden War

## Overview

Magic exists. It is rare, powerful, and controlled by ancient secret societies who operate as a hidden aristocracy. These Houses maintain a monopoly on magical knowledge and ruthlessly eliminate threats to their power structure.

Player characters are **outcast sorcerers**—those who gained power outside the system—forced to operate as criminals to survive, grow stronger, and challenge the elite's stranglehold on reality itself.

## Magic in the World

### Rarity
Approximately **1 in 10,000** individuals possess the potential for sorcery. Far fewer ever manifest it. The Houses ensure it stays that way.

### The Masquerade
The mundane public does not know magic is real. The Houses maintain this through:
- Memory alteration on witnesses
- Media control and misdirection
- Strategic elimination of problematic evidence
- Cultivating conspiracy theories to muddy the waters

Those in power (politicians, CEOs, judges) are either House members, puppets, or deliberately kept ignorant.

## The Great Houses

Ancient secret societies that form the hidden aristocracy:

- **Tools** - Temporary resources (often don't survive initiation)

## The Outcasts (Player Characters)

### Origins of Power

How did you gain sorcery outside the system?

**Contamination**  
You were exposed during a ritual. Power leaked into you before anyone could stop it.

**Inheritance**  
A grimoire found you. A dead sorcerer's final gift or accident. The Houses would burn it if they knew.

**Trauma Awakening**  
Something broke you open. Magic rushed in to fill the cracks. You don't remember all the details.

**Failed Tool**  
You were meant to be consumed as a ritual component. The binding broke. You survived changed.

**Wild Spark**  
The power just manifested. No trigger, no explanation. Statistical anomaly the Houses can't account for.

**Rogue Teaching**  
A fallen master trained you before the Houses found them. You carry their forbidden knowledge.

### Why You're Hunted

The Houses view you as:
- **Security breach** - Proof their monopoly isn't absolute
- **Contamination risk** - Unpredictable and uncontrolled power
- **Ideological threat** - Evidence that their "divine right" is a lie
- **Resource to exploit** - Useful until you become too dangerous

Some want you dead. Others want you bound into service. None want you free.

## The Criminal Underworld

### Outcast Crews

Small groups of rogue sorcerers operating outside House control:
- **2-6 members** typically (larger groups attract too much attention)
- Specialize in magical crimes the Houses won't sully themselves with
- Build networks of contacts, fences, and desperate clients
- Constantly at risk of House retaliation

### The Black Market

Underground economy dealing in:
- Stolen grimoires and ritual texts
- Confiscated artifacts
- Contraband components
- Forbidden knowledge
- Discrete magical services

**Major Hubs:**
- **The Hollows** - Night markets in forgotten urban spaces
- **The Gray Libraries** - Hidden archives of banned texts
- **Dead Drops** - Neutral ground for dangerous exchanges

### Hedge Practitioners

Mundane criminals who dabble in minor magic:
- Use stolen or inherited minor artifacts
- Don't have the spark but benefit from proximity
- Often middlemen between outcasts and desperate clients
- The Houses rarely waste effort hunting them

---

## Consequences & Complications

### House Response

When you make noise, the Houses respond:

**Low Heat:**
- Mundane investigators asking questions
- Minor curses or warnings
- Lower-level House operatives watching

**Medium Heat:**
- Magisters dispatching bound entities to hunt you
- Memory alterations forcing you to rebuild networks
- Targeted curses affecting crew and contacts

**High Heat:**
- Arch-Magisters taking personal interest
- Ritual strikes destroying safe houses
- Systematic elimination of anyone connected to you

### Corruption Risk

Power attracts attention from things worse than the Houses:
- Entities offering shortcuts at terrible cost
- Artifacts that change you with use
- Rituals that demand escalating payment
- The temptation to become what you're fighting

### The Moral Spiral

Each score forces questions:
- Are we liberating magic or just stealing it for ourselves?
- When does rebellion become its own form of tyranny?
- How much are we willing to sacrifice to win?
- What's the difference between us and them anymore?

## Setting Touchstones

### Inspiration
- **Blades in the Dark** - Criminal crews doing desperate scores
- **Mage: The Awakening** - Hidden magical orders and occult politics
- **The Invisibles** - Reality hackers vs. control structures
- **Mr. Robot** - Eat the rich through direct action
- **John Wick** - Underground societies with their own rules

### Tone
- **Dark:** The Houses are vast, ancient, and ruthless
- **Desperate:** You're outgunned and out-resourced
- **Vengeful:** Every score is payback for being denied your birthright
- **Ambitious:** You're building something even as you destroy
- **Corruptible:** Power doesn't free you—it changes you

## Playing the Game

### Core Loop
1. **Free Play** - Gather information, make contacts, recover
2. **The Score** - Plan and execute a heist/job
3. **Consequences** - Deal with Heat, entanglements, rival responses
4. **Downtime** - Recover, train, work on long-term projects
5. **Repeat** - Build your legend or become the thing you hate

### Campaign Questions
- How did this crew form?
- What do you want that the Houses denied you?
- How far will you go to get it?
- What line won't you cross? (Yet?)
- When will you realize you've already crossed it?

### Endgame Possibilities
- **Liberation** - Shatter the Houses' monopoly forever
- **Replacement** - Become a new House, "better" than the old ones
- **Escape** - Gain enough power to vanish beyond their reach
- **Corruption** - Become exactly what you swore to destroy
- **Martyrdom** - Go down swinging, but inspire others
- **Compromise** - Cut a deal and live with what it cost

---

## GM Principles

1. **The Houses are vast but not omniscient** - They have blind spots you can exploit
2. **Magic has costs** - Every shortcut demands payment eventually
3. **The masquerade is fragile** - Public exposure would change everything
4. **Power corrupts predictably** - Show them the path they're walking
5. **Desperate people do desperate things** - Both the crew and their enemies
6. **The system is the enemy** - Individual House members can be complex
7. **Victory is complicated** - Winning doesn't mean everything's better

---

## For Players

You are not heroes. You are criminals with magic, clawing your way up from nothing through murder, theft, extortion, and dark bargains.

The question isn't whether you'll get your hands dirty.

The question is **what you'll do once you've torn down the people above you and find yourself standing where they stood.**

**"The elites hold the keys to reality. You're going to steal them."**
