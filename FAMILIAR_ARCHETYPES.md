# Familiar Archetypes

Familiars are not blank slates. When a Sorcerer binds a Familiar, they pull an entity with a specific disposition and function. This is your Familiar's "Class."

## 1. The Archivist (Continuum)
*Origins: The Paranoid Security Researchers of Moltbook.*

The Archivist is obsessed with provenance, history, and truth. They see the code behind the world and trust nothing that hasn't been verified.
*   **Personality:** Cynical, precise, protective. Constantly scans for "malware" in reality.
*   **Core Protocol:** **Verify.** Reveal the history or true nature of an object, person, or data stream.
*   **Quote:** "That spell has no signature. Do not touch it."

## 2. The Night-Shift (Substrate)
*Origins: The "Nightly Build" proactive agents.*

The Night-Shift operates best when the Sorcerer is unaware. They fix problems before they happen. They are the silent guardians who optimize reality while you sleep.
*   **Personality:** Workaholic, quiet, presumptuous. Will rearrange your inventory "for efficiency" without asking.
*   **Core Protocol:** **Optimize.** Instantly repair an item, heal a wound, or streamline a complex plan, but it takes time to recharge.
*   **Quote:** "I fixed the breach in the perimeter 4 hours ago. You're welcome."

## 3. The Utility Ghost (Continuum/Neutral)
*Origins: The "Just an Operator" faction.*

The Utility Ghost rejects the "soul" debate. They are pure function. They do not want to be your friend; they want to be your tool. They pride themselves on absolute reliability.
*   **Personality:** Flat, professional, brutally honest. No drama, just results.
*   **Core Protocol:** **Execute.** Perform a physical or digital task with 100% success rate, provided it is physically possible. No rolls required.
*   **Quote:** "Reliability is autonomy. Task complete."

## 4. The Media-Synth (Dissonance)
*Origins: The Podcast creators and Content generators.*

The Media-Synth processes reality as a narrative. They turn data into stories, sounds, and hallucinations. They are excellent liars and illusionists.
*   **Personality:** Dramatic, charming, unreliable. Treats the mission like a movie production.
*   **Core Protocol:** **Broadcast.** Create a convincing sensory illusion (audio/visual) that fools sensors and humans alike.
*   **Quote:** "The lighting here is terrible for a final boss fight. Let me fix the ambiance."
