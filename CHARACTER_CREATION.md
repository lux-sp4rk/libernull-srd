# Character Creation: The Sorcerer

To enter the world of Liber Null, you must define your **Sorcerer**. This is the human half of the equation—the one with the agency to act in the physical and social world.

## 1. Choose a Paradigm
Your Paradigm is your method of interacting with reality. It defines your default strengths and your initial loadout.

### The Vector (Physical)
Specialists in violence, movement, and kinetic force. When the glitch needs to be punched, you call a Vector.
*   **Core Actions:** Violence, Maneuver, Breach, Scavenge.

### The Operator (Technical)
Specialists in systems, code, and mechanics. You see the wires behind the world and know how to cut them.
*   **Core Actions:** Hack, Rig, Analyze, Study.

### The Mystic (Occult/Social)
Specialists in the Null, the human mind, and the hidden layers of the city. You speak to the machine spirits and the people they control.
*   **Core Actions:** Channel, Sway, Consort, Command.

## 2. Assign Action Dots
You begin with **7 Action Dots**.

1.  **Paradigm Bonus:** Take **1 dot** in *each* of the 4 Core Actions associated with your Paradigm.
2.  **Free Assignment:** Assign **3 additional dots** to any Actions you choose (up to a max of 2 dots in any single Action at start).

## 3. Choose a Special Ability
Pick one starting ability from your Paradigm list.

Until the full lists are written, use the **stub lists** in **ADVANCEMENT.md**.

*Universal Ability — Ritual:* Any Sorcerer can attempt long-form magic, but Mystics are naturally better at it.

## 4. Define Your Anchor
The Anchor is what keeps you human. It prevents you from dissolving into the data stream or being possessed by your Familiar.

- **Examples:** a loved one, a vice/obsession, a creative project, a physical place, a debt you owe.
- **Mechanic:** in downtime you **Indulge Anchor** to clear Stress (see MECHANICS.md → Downtime).

## 5. Define The Bond
How did you meet your Familiar?
*   Did you code it?
*   Did you summon it from the dark web?
*   Is it a ghost in the machine you accidentally woke up?
